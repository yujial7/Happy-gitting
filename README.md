I love dolphins but I haven't figure out a way to have one at home
yet...  But we'll get there!


## A quick markdown primer:

### Different headings:

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
###### This is an H6


### Text in different style:

Hey, here is something *italicized* and here is some other thing
**bold**.

__I want this whole sentence bold, but only *this part* to be
italicized and bold.__ This part won't have any emphasis added.

### Links:

### Images: 

Check the dolphine image.  The exclamation mark in front of it means
to load the image into the text, otherwise you have just link but no
image.
